The Effect of Zoning on Housing Prices (Kendall & Tulip)
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3149272
- Exogeneity: House price = cost to build + land value + zoning effect
- Data: Land values from Australian Land Value General

COMMENTS: We can do something similar on a census division level with the construction price index (measure of land value and construction costs). Need to justify that the market is competitive enough that it would clear without zoning: paper contains some references
